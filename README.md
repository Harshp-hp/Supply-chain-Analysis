# Supply-chain-Analysis
Problem Statement
Atliq Mart is a Growing FMCG manufacturer headquarter in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat,
Ahmedabad and Vadodara. They want to expand to other metros/ Tier 1 cities in next 2 years.
Atliq Mart is currently facing a problem where a few customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is
speculates that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period,
which could have resulted in
bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain
analytics team to track the "On time", and "In Full" delivery service level for all the customers daily basis so that they can
respond swiftly to these issues.
The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure "on-timedelivery (OT) %", "In-Full-Delivery (IF) %" , And "On Time In Full (OTIF) % " of the customer orders daily basis against the
target service level set for each 
Customer.
